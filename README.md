# Determining Demographics of Perpetrators for Unsolved Homicides
Since 1980, more than 229,000 Americans have been killed in homicides that have gone unsolved. To put that into perspective, this number is higher than the combined death toll of all American military actions since WWII. Every single year, over 5,000 killers get away with murder, an average of about 14 every single day. Surprisingly, no department exists that monitors unsolved homicide cases or even tracks them. This effort is left entirely to the local police departments and self reporting.

The Murder Accountability Project is a nonprofit group organized in 2015 and dedicated to educate Americans on the importance of accurately accounting for unsolved homicides within the United States. They obtain information from federal, state and local governments about unsolved homicides and publish this information for anyone to access.

## The Data
The data used in this project ranges from 1984 to 2014. There are over 630,000 cases in this time of both solved and unsolved cases. There are 23 features in this dataset including the location, month and year, victim and perpetrator demographic information including ethnicity, age, sex and race, the relationship to the victim, the weapon used, and more. The data used for this project can be found [here](http://www.murderdata.org/p/data-docs.html).
